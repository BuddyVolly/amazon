# Satellite-Based Estimates Reveal Widespread Forest Degradation in the Amazon
Authors: Eric L. Bullock, Curtis E. Woodcock, Carlos Souza Jr., & Pontus Olofsson

## Data used in analysis:
1. The condensed version of the disturbance dataset used in analysis. The dataset contains for the first two detected disturbances: year, magnitude, and type. The dataset can be found as a GEE asset: users/bullocke/amazon/public/Bullock_Amazon_Condensed.
2. The full version of the disturbance dataset used in analysis with the raw and unorganized outputs from CODED. The dataset can be found as a GEE asset: users/bullocke/amazon/public/Bullock_Amazon_Raw
3. The stratification used to derive a sample. The strata can be found as a GEE asset: users/bullocke/amazon/public/Bullock_Amazon_Strata
4. The interpreted reference samples with location (latitude/longitude), strata code, reference label, and first three disturbance years and types (deforestation or D/ND). The reference samples are provided in the file 'reference_samples.xlsx'. Reference samples, with corresponding Landsat imagery and NDFI time series, can also be viewed at: https://bullocke.users.earthengine.app/view/amazonsamples. Example scripts for estimating area can be found at: github.com/bullocke/amazon.
